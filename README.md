## Generations

The Toyota RAV4 has evolved from a compact SUV pioneer to one of the world's best-selling vehicles across multiple generations:

- **First Generation (1994-2000)**: Launched as one of the first compact crossover SUVs, available in both two-door and four-door configurations. Featured a unibody chassis and independent suspension, powered by a 2.0L engine. Notable for introducing the car-based SUV concept that would later dominate the market.

- **Second Generation (2001-2005)**: Grew in size and moved to a car-based platform shared with the Corolla. Offered with 2.0L and 2.4L engine options, and introduced an electric RAV4 EV variant in limited markets. All-wheel drive remained optional, with improved handling and comfort compared to the first generation.

- **Third Generation (2006-2012)**: Significant redesign bringing more interior space and a more powerful 3.5L V6 engine option alongside the standard 2.4L (later 2.5L) four-cylinder. Safety features expanded significantly, and a new 4WD system with Sport and Lock modes was introduced.

- **Fourth Generation (2013-2018)**: Discontinued the V6 option in favor of an efficient 2.5L four-cylinder engine. Introduced a hybrid powertrain option in 2016. Featured significant technology updates including Toyota's Entune infotainment system and advanced safety features through Toyota Safety Sense.

- **Fifth Generation (2019-present)**: Built on Toyota's TNGA-K platform, offering improved handling and efficiency. Available in multiple variants:
  - Standard gasoline model with 2.5L engine (203 hp)
  - Hybrid model combining 2.5L engine with electric motors (219 hp combined)
  - Prime plug-in hybrid with extended electric range (302 hp combined)
  - New Woodland Edition with enhanced off-road capability
  
  Features the latest Toyota Safety Sense 2.0/2.5 and enhanced connectivity options. [[Toyota RAV4 Official Page]](https://www.toyota.com/rav4/)
