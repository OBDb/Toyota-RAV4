generations:
  - name: "First Generation (XA10)"
    start_year: 1994
    end_year: 2000
    description: "The first-generation Toyota RAV4 (Recreational Activity Vehicle: 4-wheel drive) pioneered the compact crossover SUV segment, combining car-like unibody construction and handling with available four-wheel drive capability and SUV styling. Initially available in two-door and later four-door configurations, with both hardtop and convertible variants in some markets, the original RAV4 featured compact dimensions, a relatively low ride height compared to traditional SUVs, and spirited handling thanks to its passenger car-derived platform. Powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine producing approximately 120 horsepower in most markets, paired with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission, the RAV4 prioritized on-road dynamics over serious off-road capability, though its available all-wheel drive system provided competent performance on unpaved roads and in adverse weather conditions. The interior was compact but well-designed, featuring a car-like driving position, decent materials for its price point, and a rear seat that could be folded to expand cargo capacity. The RAV4's combination of fuel efficiency, maneuverability, versatility, and a more dynamic driving experience compared to traditional truck-based SUVs resonated strongly with consumers, particularly in urban and suburban environments where its compact dimensions proved advantageous. This pioneering model established both the RAV4 nameplate and the compact crossover SUV segment that would eventually become one of the largest and most competitive in the global automotive market."

    start_year: 2000
    end_year: 2005
    description: "The second-generation Toyota RAV4 evolved the successful formula of its predecessor with increased dimensions, more refined styling, and enhanced practicality while maintaining the car-based crossover approach that had defined the original. Available primarily as a four-door model (though a two-door variant continued in some markets), the new RAV4 featured more rounded, contemporary styling with improved aerodynamics and a slightly more substantial presence. Engine options expanded to include a range of more powerful and efficient four-cylinder units, including a 2.4-liter option in some markets producing up to 161 horsepower, paired with improved manual and automatic transmissions. The chassis maintained its unibody construction but with a more rigid structure, improved suspension tuning, and better noise insulation, resulting in enhanced ride quality and reduced interior noise. The interior grew more spacious with improved materials, more comfort features, and enhanced cargo capacity, particularly in longer-wheelbase variants offered in some markets. Safety features expanded with available side airbags and anti-lock brakes. The second-generation RAV4 successfully built upon the strengths of the original while addressing some of its limitations regarding space and refinement, continuing to appeal to buyers seeking a practical, efficient alternative to larger SUVs while maintaining reasonable off-pavement capability through its available all-wheel drive system."

  - name: "Third Generation (XA30)"
    start_year: 2005
    end_year: 2012
    description: "The third-generation Toyota RAV4 grew substantially in size and capability, reflecting the segment's evolution from niche to mainstream. Available exclusively in a four-door configuration but with both short and long-wheelbase variants in some markets, this generation featured more traditional SUV styling with a side-hinged rear door (including externally mounted spare tire in some markets) and a more upright stance. Engine options expanded significantly to include larger four-cylinder units and, for the first time in the RAV4, a V6 option in North America producing 269 horsepower—creating one of the quickest vehicles in its class. Transmission options included improved manual and automatic units, with the latter gaining additional gears throughout the generation. The all-wheel drive system became more sophisticated with electronic control systems enhancing stability and traction. The interior grew considerably more spacious with available third-row seating in long-wheelbase models (primarily for North American and Asian markets), significantly increased cargo capacity, and more premium features including available leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control, and enhanced audio systems. Safety features expanded to include stability control, traction control, and multiple airbags as standard equipment. A Sport appearance package offered unique styling and suspension tuning for a more dynamic character. The third-generation RAV4 successfully expanded the model's appeal beyond its original compact crossover niche to compete more directly with traditional SUVs in terms of space and capability, while maintaining the car-like driving dynamics and efficiency that had defined the nameplate."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (XA40)"
    start_year: 2013
    end_year: 2018
    description: "The fourth-generation Toyota RAV4 returned to a more car-like approach after the relatively SUV-oriented third generation, featuring sleeker styling with a sloping roofline, unified body design (eliminating the externally mounted spare tire), and a conventional liftgate replacing the side-hinged door of its predecessor. Built on Toyota's MC platform shared with numerous other models, the new RAV4 adopted front-wheel drive as standard with optional all-wheel drive, the latter featuring a sophisticated electronic control system with various terrain modes on higher trims. Engine options were streamlined in most markets to focus on a 2.5-liter four-cylinder producing 176 horsepower, with smaller engines available in some regions and hybrid variants joining the lineup mid-generation. Transmission options centered around a six-speed automatic, with CVT used for hybrid models. The V6 option was eliminated, creating a more efficiency-focused lineup. The interior saw significant improvements in design, material quality, and technology, with available features including a touchscreen infotainment system, power liftgate, and enhanced safety technology like blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. The third-row seating option was discontinued, returning the RAV4 to a dedicated five-passenger configuration. This generation introduced the RAV4 Hybrid, combining the 2.5-liter engine with electric motors to produce 194 total system horsepower while achieving approximately 32 mpg combined—establishing a variant that would eventually become a cornerstone of the lineup. A mild refresh in 2016 brought updated styling with LED headlights, additional safety features, and improved infotainment options. The fourth-generation RAV4 successfully balanced everyday practicality with improved refinement and efficiency, helping it become one of the best-selling vehicles in its segment and establishing the groundwork for the hybrid's eventual prominence in the model line."
